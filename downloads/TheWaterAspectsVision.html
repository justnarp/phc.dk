<H1>The Vision</H1>
<H2>www.Water<B>Aspects</B><SUP>TM</SUP>.org - your open source water modelling tool</H2>
<P>WaterAspects aims to be a flexible, extendable and user-friendly tool for integrated water modelling. Potential users include water managers and engineers, scientists and researchers, students working in municipalities, regulatory authorities, consultants, universities, research institutions and more. </P>
<H2>www.Water<B>Aspects</B><SUP>TM</SUP>.org - focus on integrated planning and real time</H2>
<P>WaterAspects initial areas of focus are integrated planning and real time applications. Presently the development of WaterAspects is primarily boosted by the requirements of the EU sponsored MANTISSA project. The project is investigating the applicability of microwave dampening as a measure of rainfall in hydrological modelling. The methodology based on simple system descriptions in stochastic models is being developed and implemented in WaterAspects. Therefore, modelling using simple rainfall-runoff systems with or without stochastic state space modelling will be among the initially available features. </P>
<H2>www.Water<B>Aspects</B><SUP>TM</SUP>.org - born to grow</H2>
<P>WaterAspects aims to be able to grow on demand. Water planners, engineers and researchers need a tool that can be adapted to address project specific questions and phenomena. Any individual, person or organisation, or group, with the resources to add a new desired facility or extend its capabilities into a new domain will have the freedom to do so. Whether we are talking about modelling a case specific phenomenon, integration with an existing model, a new view in the user interface, a new mobil client or simply input data arriving in a new format, WaterAspects users will have the freedom to add it themselves.</P>
<H2>www.Water<B>Aspects</B><SUP>TM</SUP>.org - working together</H2>
<P>WaterAspects aims to integrate easily with other modelling and real time tools and services. Developed in Java with XML data WaterAspects ia platform independent and lends well to connecting this existing software on both Windows and Linux/Unix platforms. With Java and XML WaterAspects also lends well to the creation of real time Internet and mobile services. WaterAspects will seek to adhere to communication and data standards within both the water and IT-industry.</P>
<H2>www.Water<B>Aspects</B><SUP>TM</SUP>.org - quality control</H2>
<P>True code flexibility come only with endless testing. The great bulk of WaterAspects code has been developed using the test-first programming technique. Inspired by the wonderful world of extreme programming, WaterAspects seeks to live by the principle any feature or facility for which the does not exist an automated test is a non-existing feature. WaterAspects has today literally hundreds for automated tests assuring that the consequences of the ever coming changes will be discovered during development and not during use or even worse during reporting. Should a bug slip through, a new test is first created disclosing the bug and thereafter the bug is fixed. Whenever the code basis has been modified all tests are run every night on several different operating systems. The automated tests are a prerequisite for extension on demand. </P>
<H2>www.Water<B>Aspects</B><SUP>TM</SUP>.org - not an API</H2>
<P>WaterAspects will be maintained by PH-Consult. WaterAspects is expected top have constantly changing requirements. To ensure good quality and high maintainability of the code mass the maintainers will refactor mercilessly. Object oriented designs and structures will be changed before they become out of date. The WaterAspects API should (at least initially) not be used as a standard library. It will be changing with changing requirements. Code submitted to the WaterAspects code pool will be maintained when changes occur. At some state the need may arrive to create an actual API using the facade pattern.</P>
<H2>www.Water<B>Aspects</B><SUP>TM</SUP>.org - contributing to our common code</H2>
<P>If you are considering making an extension to the code it would be a good idea to contact the current project maintainer mg@phc.dk and possibly later to submit the extension for inclusion into the WaterAspects code mass. All code submitted to the project should be accompanied by corresponding unit tests. It is understood that the maintainers will not use any code submitted to the WaterAspects project before such a time that it has become part of a publicly available version WaterAspects. A written statement to this effect can be obtained on request.</P>
<H2>www.Water<B>Aspects</B><SUP>TM</SUP>.org - release plans</H2>
<P>The first version is planned for release during the first half of 2004. Pre-releases may be made available on the web before this date. </P>
<H2>www.Water<B>Aspects</B><SUP>TM</SUP>.org - license and liability</H2>
<P>WaterAspects will be released under an open source license the details of which are yet to be finalised. As an open source product WaterAspects will be released with a disclaimer. </P>
